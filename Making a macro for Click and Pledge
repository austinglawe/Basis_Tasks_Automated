I want to create a macro that does the following. 
I first want an input prompt for the user: "Please input a file path to consolidate the reports.” 
For the user input, save it as the variable "file_path".
Check if the file path exists. 
If it doesn’t exist, come up with a message that says “I’m sorry, this file path does not exist. To try again, re-run the macro with a new file path." Then kill the macro after the user clicks Okay.
If the file path does exist then check to see the number of files in the file path. Make a variable to hold that number and call it "file_path_count".
If the file_path_count is less than 1, kill the macro.
If the file_path_count is greater than 0, then check the "Home" worksheet. If A1 is not "File Name", make A1 "File Name". If B1 is not "Completed", make B1 "Completed".
From here, if file_path_count = 1,
Check column A to see where the data ends (use a max count) and save that count as the variable called "home_column_a_max".
Now take the file name of the file in "file_path" and save that as a variable called "current_file_name". Take that name and place it in column A, in the row home_column_a_max + 1.
Then go to the "All Reports Combined" worksheet and get the max number from column A of that and save that variable as "reports_column_a_max".
Then go into the the file from the file path, and copy row 14 into the "All Reports Combined" worksheet starting in column A at the reports_column_a_max + 1.
Then in the same row, column P, I want you to put the file name. (current_file_name)
Once that is done. Close the file you just copied. Then go to the "Home" tab and put an "x" in column B next to the file path name, that was just inserted in column A.
Once this is complete. End the macro.
If the file_path_count is greater than 1. Then start a loop process.
Check column A to see where the data ends (use a max count) and save that count as the variable called "home_column_a_max".
Now take the first file name of the file in "file_path" and save that as a variable called "current_file_name". Take that name and place it in column A, in the row home_column_a_max + 1.
Then go to the "All Reports Combined" worksheet and get the max number from column A of that and save that variable as "reports_column_a_max".
Then go into the the file from the file path, and copy row 14 to the end of the data. If it is row 2000, then rows 14-2000. If it is 300 then rows 14-300. If it is 15, then rows 14-15.
And then paste it into the "All Reports Combined" worksheet starting in column A at the reports_column_a_max + 1.
Then in the same rows, column P, I want you to put the file name. (current_file_name) for all the rows that were copied.
Once that is done. Close the file you just copied. Then go to the "Home" tab and put an "x" in column B next to the file path name, that was just inserted in column A.
Once this is complete continue the loop, renaming variable accordingly, until all the files are accounted for.
